# Google homepage

This is a recreation of the Google homepage. Whilst the Google homepage on it's surface seems to be very simple with few elements, I did find it tricky to make it scale up or down correctly across the various screen sizes but I weclomed the challenge as it revealed the power of CSS breakpoints.
