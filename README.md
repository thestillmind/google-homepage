# Google homepage

This is a recreation of the Google homepage. Whilst the Google homepage on it's surface seems to be very simple with few elements, I did find it tricky to make it scale up or down correctly across the various screen sizes but I weclomed the challenge as it revealed the power of CSS breakpoints.

As this is my first project I'm pleased at how it is so far, but it is far from perfect and I will revisit this once I have completed the HTML and CSS course on the Odin Project.
